binary trees:
- hierarchical data structure
1. Full bt: either 0 or 2 children
2. Complete bt: all levels are completely filled, last level has all the nodes as lefe as possible
3. Perfect bt: all the leaf nodes are completely filled
4. Balanced bt: height of tree at max log(N).
5. Degenerate bt: a skew bt, straight line, linked list basically
