n and m is given 
assume first as no of nodes and second  as no of edges.
now the next input is m set of connections between n nodes
5 6 -> 5 nodes, 6 edges
2 1
1 3 
2 4 
3 4
2 5
4 5

- Now how to store these inputs as a graph
1. Adjacency matrix way,  2. list way
1. Adjacency matrix way
 the given edges are bidirectional by default.
space : n * n 
2. vector<int> adj[n + 1]

- weighted graphs 
for adj matrix simply put the weights in the value box
for adj list though we have to use array of vector of pair instead.
